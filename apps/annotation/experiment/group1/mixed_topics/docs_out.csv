Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Baker Mayfield gave insight into how the team's culture has changed after his predecessor, seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady, retired in 2023. Mayfield, who is in his second season as the Bucs' QB1, made his remarks on the Casa De Klub podcast with ex-MLB star pitcher Corey Kluber (h/t Tom Viera of USA Today). ""The building was a little bit different with Tom in there,"" Mayfield said in part (3:35 mark). ""Obviously, playing-wise, Tom is different. He had everybody dialed in, high-strung environment, so I think everybody was pretty stressed out."" Mayfield also said that the expectation when he came in to replace Brady was to be himself and to ""bring the joy back to football for some of the guys that weren't having as much fun."" As Mayfield himself noted, he and Brady have ""very different personalities,"" and his focus was just to be himself and not fill his shoes. Mayfield also stressed that he had to do things his own way. He later added (47:20 mark): ""You hear some of the stories about if he didn't like a certain play call and he didn't like it throughout the week and they still call it in the game, there might have been a throwaway on purpose or throwing it at the running back or receiver's feet. There were a lot of mind games going on.""

The Ivorian midfielder missed last week's 1-0 upset of Liverpool, which he was initially labelled a ""doubt"" for, but it has now been reported that he is facing a couple of months on the sidelines with a torn hamstring. Sangare joins fellow midfielder Danilo in the medical bay - the Brazilian will likely be out until 2025 with a fractured ankle - while Willy Boly (calf) is close to returning but will not make the cut either. Regardless, Santo will surely not even consider changing the backline that unexpectedly shut out Liverpool last weekend, as Ola Aina, Alex Moreno, Murillo and Nikola Milenkovic shield Matz Sels.

The government has changed the rules on who will receive Winter Fuel Payments, meaning millions of those who would usually get help with heating now won’t. So, why were payments dropped and who is affected? FactCheck takes a look. What is the Winter Fuel Payment and who is losing out? The Winter Fuel Payment was introduced in 1997 to help older people pay for their heating bills over the colder months. Up until now, it has given all pensioners born before 23 September 1958 – regardless of income – up to £300 each year. But chancellor Rachel Reeves announced last month that the government would be limiting the number of people who will get the yearly Winter Fuel Payment. From September onwards, only those receiving Pension Credit or other means-tested benefits will be eligible for the payment in England and Wales. She said the cuts were necessary to plug the government’s multi-billion pound “black hole” that it has between spending commitments and the cash that’s available to fund them. Around 1.3 million households in England and Wales will continue to receive Winter Fuel Payments, but about 10 million people will lose the allowance. The figure has been calculated by subtracting the number of people who get Pension Credit (1.4m) from the latest number of people who were in receipt of the Winter Fuel Payment (11.3m). A government spokesperson told FactCheck that “eligible pensioners will also be able to benefit from the £150 Warm Home Discount scheme from October to help with their energy bills over winter.”

“We are urging pensioners to come forward and check their eligibility for Pension Credit to ensure as many people in need as possible have access to this support,” they added.",gpt-4o-mini,dt-z-1,"1.

Watch this Democrat turn the tables GOP Rep. James Comer held a House Accountability and Oversight Committee hearing on Thursday titled, “A Legacy of Incompetence: Consequences of the Biden-Harris Administration’s Policy Failures.” The laughably biased display is the latest Republican attempt to bash President Joe Biden, tarnish Vice President Kamala Harris’ record, and bolster Donald Trump's flailing presidential campaign. Not unlike the committee’s abject failure to find a single shred of evidence to impeach Biden, this new attempt did not go the Republican Party’s way. Instead of creating angry and aggrieved sound bites for MAGA minions to salivate over, the hearing was mostly a boring stream of conservative lies. Enter Democratic Rep.

Her character, Rachel, is one of the daughters of the title, and while she thrums with palpable energy, she also has a quality of stillness about her. When Rachel stares into the distance, as she tends to do, lost in thought or maybe just lost — her huge eyes shining, her face edged by flaming red hair — she brings to mind a hummingbird hovering in midair, its wings beating impossibly fast against the strongest headwind. Rachel is the youngest of the sisters who’ve convened to care for their father, Vincent (Jay O. Sanders), at the end of his life. With her older siblings Katie (Carrie Coon) and Christina (Elizabeth Olsen), Rachel drifts through the New York apartment where their father is fading away, his heartbeat now supplanted by the beeping machinery that he’s hooked up to, which creates an eerie rhythm throughout. It’s a hard, painful setup but also absurdly funny, intimate and human. Jacobs is sensitive to life’s contradictions; he knows how abruptly love seems to boil over into hate, and how quickly adult siblings can turn into whining, raging children. Set over an inexact number of days and nights, the movie tracks the sisters during the course of their vigil. Katie is the scold (and surrogate angry patriarch), who also lives in the city, while Christina (an anxious maternal type from California) plays the part of the diplomat.",gpt-4o-mini,dt-z-1,"1.

They're attempting to re-create in live action the Temple Run video game, which was first released in 2011 and centers on an explorer dashing through stone ruins while pursued by demonic monkeys. Because Temple Run's animation resembles the 900-year-old Angkor ruins, social media users can create easily recognizable replicas of the game by speeding along the UNESCO World Heritage Site's stone pathways, leaping to collect imaginary coins, and rushing headlong into stone chambers and narrow corridors. Many of the clips use sounds from the game and some feature overlays of Temple Run graphics. What wit. There are at least two big problems with the trend, however. First, Angkor's more than 100 Hindu-Buddhist temples make up what UNESCO describes as ""one of the most important archaeological sites in South-East Asia."" Spreading across 400 acres and dating back almost a millennium, the temples of the complex contain priceless carvings and sculptures that could be damaged by TikTokkers crashing around the place just because nobody gave them enough attention when they were children. “It’s nonsense,” conservationist Hans Leisen, who has worked for decades to preserve Angkor Wat's sculptures, told Bloomberg. “If you’re running through the temple, you will not see the beauty of the carvings. And if you fall or stumble, you’ll touch a wall to stabilize yourself and endanger the fragile carvings.”

Previously, if you had a Blue Basic ticket—JetBlue's version of basic economy—you could only bring aboard a small personal item that fits under the seat in front of you. Use of the overhead bins required purchasing a different fare. But starting Sept. 6, Blue Basic also entitles each passenger to one carry-on bag that fits in the cabin's overhead bins and meets these specifications from JetBlue's baggage policy webpage: ""Carry-on bags must not exceed 22"" L (55.88 cm) x 14"" W (35.56 cm) x 9"" H (22.86 cm), including wheels and handles.""
