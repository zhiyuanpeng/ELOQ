# Guide for running the annotation tool 
Please run the following: 
```
cd annotation_tool 
streamlit run annotate_app.py
```
This will run the streamlit app, and you can view the UI on your web browser. <br>
When the UI asks for a username, please put down whatever you like. It will be part of the file name of the annotation file.
