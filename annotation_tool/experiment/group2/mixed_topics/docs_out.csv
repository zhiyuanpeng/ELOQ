From 1992 until this year, European soccer fans watched the best teams on the continent compete in midweek round-robin group play. It was fun. It was comfortable. And it often provided us with a singular “group of death” almost every year that saw multiple top teams pitted against one another. The Champions League format was inherently simple—teams were placed into pots based on past European success and drawn into groups of four teams. After six matches, the top two teams from each group would qualify for the knockout round. A series of two-legged aggregate playoffs would narrow down the field to the final two teams, who would then meet in the final at a neutral site to determine European soccer superiority and conclude the club season. The old Champions League format had the history, the pageantry, and the iconic anthem. A sport steeped in tradition where fans dreamed about traveling abroad for away nights across Europe. A tune that echoed throughout the grounds and into neighboring cities around Europe before kickoff. Why change it? The better question to ask is, why not change it?

Nick Wright is trying to save athletes from themselves when it comes to the podcast game. After C.J. Stroud was overheard teasing Chicago Bears defensive back Jalen Johnson about revealing their defensive coverages on retired star cornerback Richard Sherman’s podcast ahead of their Week 2 clash on Sunday Night Football, Wright called for an end to the entire trend. The way Wright sees it, athletes are bound to reveal gameplans like Johnson did — or fall short in their love lives. Some might see Travis Kelce flirt with Taylor Swift via his massive New Heights podcast and think they can do the same, but Wright had a sharp warning for them. “People saw, ‘Did you see this player started a podcast, and that’s how he connected with Taylor Swift, what could it do for me? '” Wright said. “Here’s the answer. Not that, America. What it’s going to do for you is cause dissension and disaster.”

Stroud wasn’t just lucky that he happened to tune into Johnson’s appearance on The Richard Sherman Podcast. According to Wright, Stroud was simply smart enough to steal secrets from others’ shows and not give them out on his own. “Everything C.J. does makes him more likable, makes him seem smarter, including the fact that he doesn’t have a podcast,” Wright said.",gpt-4o-mini,dt-z-1,"1.

science_125.json,https://www.popsci.com/technology/hollow-concrete/,"Bone-like, hollow concrete design makes it 5.6 times stronger Human femurs have inspired a new cement-based construction material that is multiple times stronger than traditional concrete. But the bone-like design doesn’t get its resiliency from any new additives, but from its hollowed out shape. In a study published on September 10 in the journal Advanced Materials, researchers at Princeton University showcased how cement paste molded into hollow, tube-like architectures can create building blocks as much as 5.6 times more resistant to cracking or “sudden failure” as standard concrete—a major construction concern. “One of the challenges in engineering brittle construction materials is that they fail in an abrupt, catastrophic fashion,” Shashank Gupta, an engineering PhD candidate and study co-author, said in an accompanying statement on Monday. Their solution is derived from a human femur’s dense outer shell, known as the cortical bone. In this vital layer, numerous elliptical, tubelike parts called osteons are suspended in an organic matrix, which are then surrounded by comparatively weak interfaces, coincidentally also called “cement lines.”

Whenever stress is applied to the bone, these cement lines provide a “microstructurally preferable crack path,” the study authors write, “hence triggering in-plane crack deflection around osteons due to cement line-crack interaction.”



“One expects the material to become less resistant to cracking when hollow tubes are incorporated,” Reza Moini, an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering and study lead, said in Monday’s announcement. “We learned that by taking advantage of the tube geometry, size, shape, and orientation, we can promote crack-tube interaction to enhance one property without sacrificing another.”

The names of the justices targeted, however, were withheld by the Department of Justice — likely because they confirm Democrats’ incendiary rhetoric against the conservative members of the court is working. The DOJ announced on Thursday that Panos Anastasiou faces nine counts of making threats against a federal judge and 13 counts of making threats in interstate commerce after he sent more than 465 messages pledging harm against justices via “a public website the court maintained.”

Attorney General Merrick Garland acknowledged in the Thursday press release that the communications were rooted in Anastasiou’s desire to “retaliate against them for decisions he disagreed with.” Yet, neither he nor the Department of Justice memo announcing the arrest identified exactly which of the nine SCOTUS members and their family members were terrorized. In fact, the DOJ went out of its way in its 11-page September 18 indictment of Anastasiou to disguise which high bench presiders were in danger for upholding their constitutional duties by reducing the justices to numbers “1-6.” Six of the nine sitting SCOTUS justices were nominated to the high bench by Republican presidents. The document accusing the Alaskan of several felonies, however, shows Anastasiou’s threats were well timed not only with a Democrat-manufactured ethics scandal, but also decisions secured specifically by the court’s conservative majority. In May, as corporate media ramped up Democrat-manufactured attacks on Republican-nominated justices like Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, Anastasiou promised “lynching” for the unnamed “Justice 1,” who he previously demanded “hang[]…from an Oak tree,” and swore he would end “Justice 2” and his family’s lives by “putting a bullet in his […] head.” Additionally, Anastasiou expressed hope that Justices 1 and 2 and their families would be killed by “‘fellow veterans’ who ‘spray’ their homes with bullets.”

Hours after SCOTUS ruled 6 to 3 on July 1 that presidents have “absolute immunity” for “actions within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority” and “at least presumptive immunity” for all “official acts,” Anastasiou threatened to “murder,” “torture,” and “execute” six of the justices with “intent to impede, intimidate, and interfere” with the court’s decision-making authority.",gpt-4o-mini,dt-z-1,"1.

The last 40 public polls included in The New York Times polling average of the vital battleground state show her leading in 28, tied in four and trailing former President Donald J. Trump in eight.

Ms. Harris, who is set to hold a rally in Madison on Friday evening, was up by four percentage points in the latest survey from Marquette Law School, widely considered the gold standard of Wisconsin polling. The Times polling average has shown her leading every day, albeit narrowly, since Aug. 6.

And yet, in what has appeared to be Democrats’ strongest battleground state even when President Biden was still in the race, Democrats, Republicans and even the state’s pollsters can agree on one thing: They don’t fully trust the polling and don’t believe Ms. Harris is ahead by as much as some of the surveys say.

These viral travel hacks aren't likely to make flying better—and could make things worse. Some days, “air travel” feels like a shorter way of saying “global conspiracy to leave me bankrupt and bewildered.”

So it’s no wonder internet users go in search of travel hacks to save money, cut red tape, and ensure a modicum of in-flight comfort (you poor deluded fool). But while trying to satisfy those worthwhile ends, some hacks go viral on message boards, travel sites, and, especially, TikTok, by proposing solutions that may be, depending on the hack, ineffective, unproven, overcomplicated, against the rules, or downright dangerous. Worse, the online popularity of such bad advice seems to earn it a weird legitimacy. Maybe this can be hard to remember in a world where views and followers are regarded as the be-all and end-all, but “viral” doesn’t automatically equal “good.” Just look at the milk crate challenge. Or Covid-19. As a public service, then, here are five recent examples of viral air travel hacks you should ignore, along with some advice on what to try instead. Questionable Air Travel Hack #1: Wear Red to Get Better Treatment

(An authoritative and appealing experienced traveler in red | Credit: Delta News Hub)

The hack: According to some psychological studies, people wearing red are perceived to be more authoritative and even more attractive (a result of the so-called “red dress effect”) than the beige-clad masses. Armchair color theorists (amplified by media enablers) therefore advise flyers to wear shades of red when traveling so that airport security agents, airline workers, and flight crews will subconsciously regard those scarlet-sporting passengers as important, desirable, and deserving of a seamless TSA experience and maybe an upgrade to business class.",gpt-4o-mini,dt-z-1,"1. Many viral travel hacks found online, especially on platforms like TikTok, are ineffective, unproven, or dangerous, and may not improve the flying experience.

2. The popularity of a travel hack does not guarantee its effectiveness or safety, as evidenced by other viral trends that have proven harmful, such as the milk crate challenge.

3. One viral travel hack suggests that wearing red clothing can lead to better treatment from airport staff and flight crews due to the psychological perception of authority and attractiveness associated with the color red.

4. The belief that wearing red will enhance a traveler's experience is based on the ""red dress effect,"" which posits that individuals in red may be viewed as more important or desirable.

5. The document serves as a public service warning against following certain viral travel hacks that lack evidence of effectiveness.

6. The allure of social media fame can lead to the adoption of questionable advice in travel, where views and followers are prioritized over the actual quality of the information shared.","1. The rise of social media has significantly influenced the way people approach travel planning and sharing experiences.
2. Many travelers share their experiences and tips online, contributing to the emergence of new travel hacks.

Here are 11 methods for booking a cheap cruise. Bag a shoulder season deal

In travel, shoulder season is the period between peak season and low season, and you’ll find it in cruising, too. Cruise lines don’t only offer consistently lower prices during shoulder season sailings—they’ll typically offer regular flash sales during these times, too. “Keep an eye out for flash sales during shoulder seasons,” says Elaine Warren, founder of specialist cruise travel agency FamilyCruiseCompanion.com. “Cruise lines are desperate to fill ships during these times. I've found some real steals by being ready to book as soon as I see a great offer pop up.”

Bear in mind that different regions have different shoulder seasons. In Alaska, for example, the main shoulder seasons are April and early May, and then at the end of summer between September and mid-October. Europe’s shoulder seasons are April and May, and then again in September to November. For Caribbean cruises, it’s May, June, and July and then in December, January, and March. Try to book at least six months in advance

Passionate cruisers Don and Heidi Bucolo, founders of top cruise blog EatSleepCruise.com, say that advance booking can be a key to great deals. “Our advice is to book cruises between 6 and 12 months in advance. Typically, cruise prices tend to go up closer to the sail date, especially for newer ships or for more desirable travel dates.”

Consider repositioning cruises

Repositioning cruises are one-way sailings during which ships relocate from one region to another, like when they switch between summer Europe sailings to a winter Caribbean schedule.",gpt-4o-mini,dt-z-1,"1. Shoulder season refers to the period between peak season and low season in travel, and it is a key time to find lower prices on cruise sailings.

2. Cruise lines often conduct flash sales during shoulder seasons as they seek to fill ships, making it advantageous for travelers to watch for these offers.

3. Different regions have distinct shoulder seasons, such as April and early May, and September to mid-October for Alaska; April and May, and September to November for Europe; and May, June, July, and December to March for the Caribbean.

4. Booking a cruise at least six months in advance is recommended by experienced cruisers, as prices generally increase as the sail date approaches.

5. Newer ships and desirable travel dates tend to see more significant price increases as the sail date nears, making early booking even more crucial.

6. Repositioning cruises are one-way sailings where ships move from one region to another, offering unique travel opportunities and potentially lower fares.","1. Shoulder seasons are defined as the periods between the peak and off-peak travel times, offering a balance between favorable weather and lower tourist crowds.  
2. Shoulder seasons can vary by destination, typically occurring in spring and fall when weather conditions are still pleasant but tourist numbers decrease.
