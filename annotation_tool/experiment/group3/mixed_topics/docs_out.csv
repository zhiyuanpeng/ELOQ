Al Michaels may have lost a few ticks on his fastball, but you can still count on him to tell it like it is, as he did Thursday night with Fireman Ed. Fireman Ed Anzalone wasn’t the ringleader Jets fans asked for, he was the ringleader the Jets put on their fans. The Jets put him on the big screen at Giants Stadium in 1986 and he stayed until 2012, when Anzalone dramatically walked away from his self-assumed superfan responsibilities. He’s been back for over a decade now, but while most national broadcasters forgot about his hiatus, Michaels did not. “Fireman Ed has been here for years, took a brief respite a few years ago after the butt fumble game when he said, ‘I’m not coming back.’ But he did.” pic.twitter.com/BfqUCm9yDz — Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing) September 20, 2024



“This crowd is pumped up as I can remember before a Jets game,” Michaels said as the camera panned to Anzalone before the Thursday Night Football kickoff on Amazon Prime. “Fireman Ed has been here for years, took a brief respite a few years ago after the butt fumble game when he said, ‘I’m not coming back.’ But he did.”

“And there he is again leading J-E-T-S Jets! Jets! Jets!” Michaels added with a chuckle. Maybe the chuckle was unrelated, but it was almost like Michaels was laughing at the drama surrounding Fireman Ed after calling out his near three-year hiatus. As Michaels noted, Fireman Ed voluntarily walked away from his superfan title in 2012 during the infamous Butt Fumble game.",gpt-4o-mini,dt-z-1,"1.

Sleep apnea is an increasingly common condition where a person temporarily stops breathing while asleep, which can cause blood oxygen levels to drop.

Matt Gaetz. The late-Thursday night federal filing references sealed eyewitness statements that describe a high school junior attending a party in a home laden with drugs, where Gaetz and other adults came together for sex. As NOTUS reports, Gaetz has consistently claimed he was not at the July 2017 party, but testimony from his own ex-girlfriend rebuts that claim. The witnesses cite the presence of “alcohol, cocaine, ecstasy … and marijuana” and confirm that those present were there to “engage in sexual activities.” They also confirm the presence of a 17-year-old girl who was “naked” at the party.

Amiensus – Reclamation Pt. II (progressive meloblack)

Let’s be honest with each other - there is no good definition for what US Black Metal really is. Like many other labels on the Northern part of the American continent, USBM is an umbrella term which hides multiplicity beneath it, doing more to obscure than to elucidate. Which is not to say that the label is completely useless but rather that we should be careful when deploying it. Mostly this is because USBM has been changing, like all genres, over the last few years. The more atmospheric kind of black metal that defined its first decade or two of existence has been fading from view a bit and, in its place, a more melodic and progressive form has been emerging.

music_45.json,https://www.stereogum.com/2281274/stream-nina-rysers-fantastic-adventurous-new-album-water-giants/music/,"Stream Nina Ryser’s Fantastic, Adventurous New Album Water Giants Nina Ryser — of Palberta, @, and Nina Ryser fame — has a new solo album out today, and it may be the most fascinating record you hear this week. Water Giants finds the Philly musician venturing all over the map, from heady electronic instrumentals to scrappy indie-pop tunes, injecting it all with a common sensibility. With songs like the surging electro-pop track “Cuz You,” the strings-and-piano ditty “You Are What You Eat,” and the wobbly synth excursion “Piggy Boys” crammed together into the same tracklist, it makes perfect sense with the junkyard twee of “Beauty In Grime” levels off into a droning ambient sketch.

Water Giants is dotted with such satisfying twists and turns. Ryser bills it as her first solo album not recorded alone at home, creating in the studio with engineer Lucas Knapp instead. The album still has some homespun qualities to it, but the DIY legacy Ryser brings to the music meshes with the more professional aspects of the sound in rewarding ways. It reminds me of a more playful iteration of the Microphones or a lower-fi Magnetic Fields at times, and my colleague Tom Breihan has already pointed out the resemblance to the Blow.

Fans of Ryser’s own robust discography — including advance singles “Things I Claim” and “Underestimate” — will of course find much to love here as well. Stream the album below.

And the James Webb Space Telescope just captured a vivid view of the scene. The interacting galaxies, called Arp 107, collided hundreds of millions of years ago, and a bridge of stars has formed between them as they undergo the long, gradual process of merging into one. Our Milky Way, too, has merged before, and may, in the distant future, meld with an even larger galaxy. Here's what you're seeing in Webb's new image, which shows an event transpiring 450 million light-years way:

- Older stars and the bridge: The white areas are older stars, which you can see plenty of in both the galaxies. These stars also make up the ""tenuous bridge of gas and stars that runs between [the galaxies],"" the European Space Agency (ESA) explained. - Vibrant star formation: When galaxies collide with one another, their gasses meet and condense. The resulting weighty clouds of gas can collapse, driving the formation of new stars.
